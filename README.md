## Using the Scripts

### Files

- **analyses**/
  - folder for analyses of experimental and simulated data
  - analyses scripts can be found in **subfolder/1_srcAna/**
  - results are saved in **subfolder/3_results/**
  - for some analyses intermediate data are saved in **subfolder/2_dataEv/** for further evaluations
- **psychExp**/
  - placeholder directory structure for experimental data (available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6546572)
- **simulations**/
  - includes the scripts to run the simulations with the model to generate all analyzed data
  - script to run a single simulation (*parallel.py*) can be found in **subfolder/1_srcSim/**
  - the shell scripts (*run.sh*) help to run multiple simulations in parallel
  - data are saved in **subfolder/2_dataRaw/** and **subfolder/4_dataEv/**, data generated for the study available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6546572

### Results Pipelines

Description of the results generated in Python. For several figures, additional image processing software was used to create the final figures (to adjust the layout).

Results | analysis | experimental data | simulated data | simulations | comment
-|-|-|-|-|-
Figure 3 | **manuscript_global_performance**/ and **manuscript_global_performance_vps**/ | yes | yes | 60 simulations from **001e...**/ |
Figure 4 | *BOLDfromDifferentSources_ANA.py* (function `rate_distribution`) | *simulations.py* (standard arguments), *get_weightDist.py* | two plots are generated, weight distribution plot is directly generated by the simulation script *get_weightDist.py*
Figure 5 | *BOLDfromDifferentSources_ANA.py* (function `with_vs_without_normalization`) | *simulations.py X 1 Y* | X = `input_factor` = 1--resting, 5--pulse; Y = `simID` = (0--39)
Figure 6 | *BOLDfromDifferntSources_ANA.py* (function `pulses_visualization`) | *simulations.py 5 1 Y* | Y = `simID` = (0--39), lineplots are generated individually
Figure S1 | *BOLDfromDifferntSources_ANA.py* (function `make_sustained_input_plot`) | *simulations.py 1.2 3 Y* | Y = `simID` = (0--39), Figure 7 and S1 are generated together, lineplots are generated individually
Figure S2 | *BOLDfromDifferntSources_ANA.py* (function `make_sustained_input_plot`) | *simulations.py 1.2 3 Y* | Y = `simID` = (0--39), Figure 7 and S1 are generated together, lineplots are generated individually
