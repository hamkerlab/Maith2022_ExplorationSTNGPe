## Using the Scripts

### Files

- **analyses**/
  - folder for analyses of experimental and simulated data
  - analyses scripts can be found in **subfolder/1_srcAna/**
  - results are saved in **subfolder/3_results/**
  - for some analyses intermediate data are saved in **subfolder/2_dataEv/** for further evaluations
- **psychExp**/
  - placeholder directory structure for experimental data (available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6546572)
- **simulations**/
  - includes the scripts to run the simulations with the model to generate all analyzed data
  - script to run a single simulation (*parallel.py*) can be found in **subfolder/1_srcSim/**
  - the shell scripts (*run.sh*) help to run multiple simulations in parallel
  - data are saved in **subfolder/2_dataRaw/** and **subfolder/4_dataEv/**, data generated for the study available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6546572

### Results Pipelines

Description of the results generated in Python. For several figures, additional image processing software was used to create the final figures (to adjust the layout).

Results | analysis | experimental data | simulated data | simulations | comment
-|-|-|-|-|-
Figure 3 | **manuscript_global_performance**/ and **manuscript_global_performance_vps**/ | yes | yes | 60 simulations from **001e...**/ | arguments for function `plot_column`: `mode='scatter'` and `classic_plot=1` (only in **manuscript_global_performance**/)
Figure 4 | **manuscript_SRtask_results**/ | yes | yes | 60 simulations from **001e...**/ and **002e...**/ each |
Figure 5 | **manuscript_vp_learning_details**/ | yes | no | - |
Figure 6 | **manuscript_Figure_activities_and_weightchanges**/ | no | yes | a single simulation from **001e...**/ and **007a...**/ | various simulation times are set manually in the analysis (taken from the output file of the simulation), a change of the simulation used requires an adjustment of these times
Figure S1 | **manuscript_global_performance**/ | no | yes | 60 simulations from **001e...**/ | arguments for function `plot_column`: `classic_plot=0` (only in **manuscript_global_performance**/)
Figure S2 | **manuscript_vp_learning_details**/ | yes | no | - |
