## Using the Scripts

### Files

- **analyses**/
  - folder for analyses of experimental and simulated data
  - analyses scripts can be found in **subfolder/1_srcAna/**
  - results are saved in **subfolder/3_results/**
  - for some analyses intermediate data are saved in **subfolder/2_dataEv/** for further evaluations
- **psychExp**/
  - placeholder directory structure for experimental data (available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6546572)
- **simulations**/
  - includes the scripts to run the simulations with the model to generate all analyzed data
  - script to run a single simulation (*parallel.py*) can be found in **subfolder/1_srcSim/**
  - the shell scripts (*run.sh*) help to run multiple simulations in parallel
  - data are saved in **subfolder/2_dataRaw/** and **subfolder/4_dataEv/**, data generated for the study available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6546572

### Results Pipelines

Description of the results generated in Python. For several figures, additional image processing software was used to create the final figures (to adjust the layout and/or colors).

Results | analysis | experimental data | simulated data | simulations | comment
-|-|-|-|-|-
Figure 3 | **manuscript_global_performance**/ and **manuscript_global_performance_vps**/ | yes | yes | 60 simulations from **014a...**/ and **014b...**/ each | in **manuscript_global_performance**/ use run.sh (which also generates further figures); in **manuscript_global_performance_vps**/ run make_plot.py twice, with arguments 0 and 1
Figure 4 | **manuscript_SRtask_results**/ | yes | yes | 60 simulations from **014a...**/ and **014b...**/ each | use run.sh (which also generates further figures)
Figure 5 | **manuscript_vp_learning_details**/ | yes | no | - | run make_plot.py twice, with arguments 0 and 1
Figure 6 | **manuscript_Figure_activities_and_weightchanges**/ | no | yes | 60 simulations from **014a...**/ and **014b...**/ and a single simulation from **007a...**/| use run.sh (which also generates further figures), various simulation times are set manually in the analysis (taken from the output file of the simulation), a change of the simulation used requires an adjustment of these times
Figure 7 | **manuscript_weight_morphing**/ | no | yes | 6400 simulations from **013...**/ | 
Figure S1 | **manuscript_SRtask_results**/ | yes | yes | 60 simulations from **001e...**/ and **001f...**/ each | use run.sh (which also generates further figures)
Figure S2 | **manuscript_global_performance**/ | no | yes | 60 simulations from **001e...**/ and **001f...**/ each | use run.sh (which also generates further figures)
Figure S3 | **manuscript_global_performance**/ | no | yes | 60 simulations from **014a...**/ | set `weight_plot=True` (extra_functions.py line 267)
Figure S4 | **manuscript_clockwise**/ | yes | no | - | run make_plot.py twice, with arguments 0 and 1
Figure S5 | **manuscript_vp_learning_details**/ | yes | no | - | run make_plot.py with argument 0
Figure S6 | **manuscript_SRtask_results**/ | yes | yes | 60 simulations from **014c...**/ and **014d...**/ each | use run.sh (which also generates further figures)
Figure S7 | **manuscript_Figure_activities_and_weightchanges**/ | no | yes | 60 simulations from **001e...**/ and **001f...**/ | use run.sh (which also generates further figures)
Figure S9 | **manuscript_statistics**/ | yes | yes | - | see below

All statistical tests of the study are performed in **analyses/manuscript_statistics**/ which requires the prior performance of the analyses: **manuscript_SRtask_results**/ (use run.sh), **manuscript_global_performance**/ (use run.sh), and **manuscript_global_performance_vps**/ (with arguments 0 and 1).
